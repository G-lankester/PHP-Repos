        A man loses his identity while living under a repressive regime. In a story based on George Orwell's classic novel, 
        Winston Smith is a government employee whose job involves the rewriting of history in a manner that casts 
        his fictional country's leaders in a charitable light. His trysts with Julia provide his only measure 
        of enjoyment, but lawmakers frown on the relationship -- and in this closely monitored society, there is no escape 
        from Big Brother
